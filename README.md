This repository demonstrates a complete **CI/CD pipeline** using the following workflow:
1. **Code Push to GitHub**: Developers push code to the repository.
2. **GitHub Actions**: Triggers automated workflows upon code updates.
3. **Docker Image Build**: Builds Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub.
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploys the latest Docker image to the production server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository.
- Docker installed on the local machine.
- A Docker Hub account for storing images.
- SSH access to the production server for deployment.
